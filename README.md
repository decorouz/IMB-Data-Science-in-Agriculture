## Data Science in Agriculture. Land use classification.

##### A guided project from *https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/course-v1:IBM+GPXX0KHHEN+v1*

### About

In this repository, I explored how land use types can be classified based on aerial and satellite photographs of the earth's surface. I learn to build my own photo masks based on ready-made masks and display them on the screen, I alspo learn how to upload photos, transform pixels and colors into a data set. Then learn how to build a classifier and predict land use masks based on it.

The laboratory consists of four stages:

- Download and visualization of images
- DataSet creation
- Classification model creation
- Create your own mask of land use

### Learning Outcome include how to:

- Download and transform images.
- Create a DataSet of the colors of images.
- Build a classification model.
- Build land use masks based on a classifier.
