# Data Science in Agriculture: Land use classification.

### About

Explore how land use types can be classified based on aerial and satellite photographs of the earth's surface. We will learn to build our own photo masks based on ready-made masks and display them on the screen, we will learn how to upload photos, transform pixels and colors into a data set. Then we will learn how to build a classifier and predict land use masks based on it.

The stages:

- Download and visualization of images
- DataSet creation
- Classification model creation
- Create your own mask of land use

### Skills I learned from this project

- How to download and transform images.
- Create a DataSet of the colors of images.
- Build a classification model.
- Build land use masks based on a classifier.
